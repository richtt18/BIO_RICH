  <h1> ABOUT SCHMITT </h1>
    <bold>Hi my name is Rich Schmitt. Im learning to code Full Stack Web Development at George Washington University.
    This is my first website. Currently working on a portfolio of interesting and good looking websites and apps. I love animals and skateboarding.
    I work for a company called WAG! where I can help people with on demand dog care through our mobile app. Download the WAG! app and use my ivitation code RICH31311
    for $20 in credit towards your first walks. I love the internet. One of my favorite websites is soundcloud. Im very interested in drones and crypto currencies.
    I learned drone mapping technology during my 2015 internship with senseFly doing basic repairs, test flights, data analysis, and tech support on the eBee UAV. Now a day I like to fly FPV Lumenier racing drones.
    Im also very interested in the evolution of crypto currencies and Ethereum application development on the block chain.
